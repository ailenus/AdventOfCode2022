My participation in [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Each day is a package containing a main class. For example, day 1 is the
package `day1`, which contains a main class `day1.Main`.

The packages that contain anything more than the main class are:

- `day1`
  - `Main` class
  - `Elf` class
- `day5`
  - `Main` class
  - `SupplyStack` class
- `day7`
  - `Main` class
  - `model` package
    - `Directory` class
    - `FileSystem` class
  - `controller` package
    - `FileSystemController` class
